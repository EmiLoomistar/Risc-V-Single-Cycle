# Risc-V-Single-Cycle

Hi everyone Emi here!

So I implemented a Risc V processor in VHDL.
This was mainly an excercise to improve and in the future I hope to target some fpga and maybe go for a multi cycle implementation.
The project was made in Vivado and was based in the book by Harris & Harris.
